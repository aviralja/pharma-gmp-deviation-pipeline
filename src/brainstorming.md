## Section 3

## Question:
Recommended Investigation Tool

## Answer:
### Recommended Investigation Tools
Based on the research available and the context provided, we recommend two investigation tools to perform this investigation: Fishbone (6M analysis) and 5 Why.

#### 1. Fishbone (6M analysis)
The first recommendation should always be the Fishbone (6M analysis). This tool is ideal for identifying the root cause of a problem by analyzing the various factors that contribute to it. The 6M tool stands for:
- **Man**: People involved in the process, including their skills, training, and experience.
- **Material**: The raw materials, components, and equipment used in the process.
- **Machine/Equipment**: The machinery, tools, and equipment used in the process.
- **Measurement**: The methods and instruments used to measure the process.
- **Method**: The procedures and techniques used in the process.
- **Environment**: The physical and environmental conditions in which the process takes place.

To use the Fishbone (6M analysis) tool, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the problem**: Clearly define the issue that needs to be addressed.
2. **Determine the scope**: Establish the boundaries of the investigation, including the departments, personnel, and processes involved.
3. **Gather data**: Collect relevant information about the process, including documents, records, and witness statements.
4. **Map the 6M factors**: Create a fishbone diagram to visualize the various 6M factors that contribute to the problem.
5. **Analyze each factor**: Investigate each 6M factor to identify potential causes of the problem.
6. **Identify the root cause**: Determine the underlying cause of the problem by analyzing the data and identifying the most likely cause.

Example of a Fishbone (6M analysis) diagram:

| 6M Factor | Potential Causes |
| --- | --- |
| Man | Lack of training, inadequate supervision |
| Material | Contaminated raw materials, defective components |
| Machine/Equipment | Malfunctioning machinery, inadequate maintenance |
| Measurement | Inaccurate instruments, inadequate calibration |
| Method | Inefficient procedures, inadequate documentation |
| Environment | Poor working conditions, inadequate lighting |

#### 2. 5 Why
The second recommended investigation tool is the 5 Why method. This tool is a simple and effective way to drill down to the root cause of a problem by asking "why" five times.

To use the 5 Why method, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the problem**: Clearly define the issue that needs to be addressed.
2. **Ask "why"**: Ask "why" the problem occurred, and document the response.
3. **Ask "why" again**: Ask "why" the previous response occurred, and document the response.
4. **Repeat the process**: Continue asking "why" four more times, each time drilling down to a more fundamental cause.
5. **Identify the root cause**: Determine the underlying cause of the problem by analyzing the data and identifying the most likely cause.

Example of a 5 Why analysis:

1. **Why**: The AUTO-INJECTOR trays contain black specks.
	* Response: The trays were not properly cleaned before packaging.
2. **Why**: The trays were not properly cleaned before packaging.
	* Response: The cleaning process was inadequate.
3. **Why**: The cleaning process was inadequate.
	* Response: The cleaning solution was not properly mixed.
4. **Why**: The cleaning solution was not properly mixed.
	* Response: The mixing process was not followed correctly.
5. **Why**: The mixing process was not followed correctly.
	* Response: The operator was not trained properly.

By using the Fishbone (6M analysis) and 5 Why methods, you can identify the root cause of the problem and implement corrective actions to prevent similar issues in the future.
