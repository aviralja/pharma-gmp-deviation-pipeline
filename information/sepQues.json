  {
    "question": "What Went Wrong",
    "prompt": "In 3-4 sentences, describe what fundamentally went wrong in this deviation. Focus on the TYPE of problem rather than specific details.\n\nExample: \"A critical process parameter exceeded its validated limit during manufacturing. The automated monitoring system failed to trigger an alarm. The deviation was discovered during batch record review several hours after it occurred.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "What Failed or Was Bypassed",
    "prompt": "Describe what control, system, procedure, or barrier was supposed to prevent this but didn't work. Explain why it failed.\n\nExample: \"The temperature monitoring system with automatic alarm should have alerted operators when storage temperature exceeded 8°C. The alarm failed because the sensor had drifted out of calibration and the backup manual checks were not performed as required by SOP.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Process and Activity Context",
    "prompt": "Describe where in your manufacturing/quality process this happened and what operation was being performed.\n\nExample: \"During aseptic filling of sterile injectable vials in the Grade A filling line, while performing routine production of Product X.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Why This Matters (Impact and Criticality)",
    "prompt": "Explain why this deviation is significant. Describe the impact on product quality, patient safety, or GMP compliance.\n\nExample: \"This affects sterile product integrity. Temperature excursion during storage could allow microbial growth. Three commercial batches were exposed to out-of-specification conditions before detection, representing potential patient safety risk.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Root Cause Indicators",
    "prompt": "What do you believe caused this to happen? Describe the underlying factors - equipment condition, human factors, procedural gaps, material issues, etc.\n\nExample: \"Primary cause appears to be equipment aging combined with inadequate preventive maintenance. The temperature sensor was past its calibration due date by 2 weeks. Additionally, the backup manual temperature checks were inconsistently performed due to high workload and inadequate supervision.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "How It Was Detected",
    "prompt": "Describe how and when this deviation was discovered. Was it caught by design or by accident?\n\nExample: \"Discovered during routine weekly batch record review by QA, approximately 72 hours after the temperature excursion occurred. The automated alarm system should have detected this in real-time but failed. No one noticed during routine facility walk-throughs.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Historical and Recurrence Context",
    "prompt": "Has anything similar happened before at your facility or in your industry? Is this a recurring issue or first-time occurrence?\n\nExample: \"Similar temperature alarm failures occurred twice in the past 18 months on different cold storage units, both due to calibration drift. Previous CAPA was to increase calibration frequency, but implementation was incomplete. This suggests a systemic issue with our preventive maintenance program.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Scope and Extent",
    "prompt": "Describe how widespread this problem is. How many batches, products, or areas are affected? Could it have affected more?\n\nExample: \"Three commercial batches of Product X stored in Cold Room 2 during the 72-hour period. Approximately 15,000 vials potentially affected. Other cold rooms in the facility were checked and found compliant. Same model temperature sensors are used in 5 other storage areas, presenting similar risk.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "System and Equipment Involvement",
    "prompt": "If equipment, systems, or automation were involved, describe their role, type, and condition. Include any material or environmental factors.\n\nExample: \"Involved a Thermo-Fisher cold storage unit (Model XYZ-100) with integrated temperature monitoring. Unit is 8 years old, scheduled for replacement next year. Uses PT100 RTD sensors that require annual calibration. Facility HVAC was functioning normally. No material defects identified.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Technical Keywords and Search Terms",
    "prompt": "List specific technical terms, equipment types, problem types, and industry terminology that describe this deviation. These will be used to find similar cases.\n\nFormat as comma-separated terms:\n\nExample: \"temperature excursion, cold storage, RTD sensor, calibration drift, alarm failure, sterile storage, injectable product, continuous monitoring, parametric release, real-time monitoring failure, preventive maintenance gap\""
